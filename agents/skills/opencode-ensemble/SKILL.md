# OpenCode Ensemble

Use OpenCode Ensemble as a coordination system, not a shortcut for avoiding judgment. Parallel agents work best when the lead owns decomposition, sequencing, review, merge, and verification.

## Core Principle

Spawn teammates only for independent, verifiable work. A good Ensemble team has narrow task ownership, clear dependencies, and a lead that integrates results deliberately.

## Use Ensemble When

- Work can be split into independent research, implementation, test, or review slices.
- A read-only scout can map unfamiliar code before edits begin.
- Multiple files or subsystems can be changed without overlapping ownership.
- A risky change benefits from `plan_approval: true` before edits.
- A final reviewer can inspect merged changes without creating another branch.

## Do Not Use Ensemble When

- The task is small enough for one agent to finish quickly.
- The work is tightly coupled and every teammate would need the same files.
- The lead cannot describe each teammate's output and success criteria.
- The user needs one coherent design decision rather than parallel exploration.
- You are tempted to spawn agents because the task feels hard but not divisible.

## Lead Workflow

1. Decide whether parallelism is justified.
2. Create a team with `team_create`.
3. Add tasks with `team_tasks_add`; use `depends_on` for sequencing.
4. Spawn teammates one at a time with `team_spawn`.
5. Use `worktree: false` for read-only `explore` teammates.
6. Use `plan_approval: true` for risky implementation work.
7. Wait for teammate messages instead of polling status repeatedly.
8. Read full results with `team_results` when messages are truncated or consequential.
9. Shut down completed teammates with `team_shutdown`.
10. Merge branches with `team_merge`; inspect the diff before trusting it.
11. Run project verification before `team_cleanup` and before claiming done.

## Role Defaults

| Role | Agent | Worktree | Model guidance | Use for |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Scout | `explore` | `false` | `openai/gpt-5.3-codex-spark` | Codebase mapping, risk discovery, file ownership plan |
| Builder | `build` | `true` | `anthropic/claude-opus-4-7` | Narrow implementation slice |
| QA | `build` | `true` | strong balanced model | Tests, fixtures, regression coverage |
| Reviewer | `explore` | `false` | `openai/gpt-5.3-codex-spark` | Diff review, risk review, missed-test review |

Start with two or three teammates. Add more only when the work has more independent slices than active teammates.

## Load References As Needed

- Need a team shape? Read `references/coordination-patterns.md`.
- Need prompts? Read `references/prompt-recipes.md`.
- Need a pre-spawn, merge, cleanup, or verification gate? Read `references/lead-checklists.md`.
- Something feels off or too chatty? Read `references/anti-patterns.md`.
- Creating or improving this skill? Read `references/eval-scenarios.md`.

## Hard Rules

- Do not invent task IDs. `team_tasks_add` generates IDs; use the IDs returned by earlier calls when setting `depends_on` or `claim_task`.
- Keep teammate prompts short. The plugin already injects team role, allowed tools, worktree context, and the required task-result format.
- Do not give teammates vague prompts like "fix the bug" or "work on tests".
- Do not ask teammates to use lead-only tools such as `team_spawn`, `team_shutdown`, `team_merge`, `team_cleanup`, or `team_view`.
- Do not tell teammates to report only in plain text. They must use `team_message`.
- Do not merge a teammate branch without reading its result and inspecting the diff.
- Do not call the work complete until the repository's verification commands pass or you have clearly reported the blocker.

## Minimal Example

```ts
team_create({ name: "checkout-idempotency" })

team_tasks_add({
  tasks: [
    { content: "Map checkout webhook flow and risky files", priority: "high" },
    { content: "Implement duplicate-webhook idempotency guard", priority: "high" },
  ],
})
// Record returned IDs, for example: task_abc123 for scout and task_def456 for builder.

team_tasks_add({
  tasks: [
    { content: "Add duplicate-webhook regression tests", priority: "high", depends_on: ["task_def456"] },
  ],
})
// Record returned QA task ID, for example: task_ghi789.

team_tasks_add({
  tasks: [
    { content: "Review merged diff for correctness and missed tests", priority: "medium", depends_on: ["task_def456", "task_ghi789"] },
  ],
})

team_spawn({
  name: "scout",
  agent: "explore",
  worktree: false,
  model: "openai/gpt-5.3-codex-spark",
  claim_task: "task_abc123",
  prompt: "Trace the checkout webhook flow. Report files, data model, existing tests, risks, and a smallest-safe-change plan. Do not edit files.",
})

team_spawn({
  name: "api-dev",
  agent: "build",
  model: "anthropic/claude-opus-4-7",
  plan_approval: true,
  claim_task: "task_def456",
  prompt: "Use scout's findings to implement only the idempotency guard. Commit your work and send a task-result message with files changed and tests run.",
})
```
