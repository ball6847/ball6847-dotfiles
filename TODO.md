# Things I want to improve

- [ ] powershell script to link `alacritty.toml` to `%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.toml`
- [ ] cannot copy text from opencode when running in tmux
- [ ] sometimes nvim leaves vertical line on screen when using with tmux
- [ ] if it is possible, I want to remove `doppler` from tmux windows title
- [ ] tmux status at the top really mess up neovim, fix at neovim side if possible or move the status line back to bottom (currently at bottom)

## Completed

- [x] experiment using ctrl+n or ctrl+t to create new window (is tmux has tab support?)
- [x] active window color indicator in tmux status bar to be more standout
- [x] remove doppler from nvin alias (v)
- [x] `ctrl+backspace` in neovim buffer to delete previous word (actually it is working in windows terminal)
- [x] try to make alacritty to start tmux automatically
