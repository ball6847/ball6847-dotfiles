# Things I want to improve

- [ ] make kimi-cli automatically start with YOLO mode
- [ ] make mistral vibe start with YOLO mode

Completed

- [x] cannot copy text from opencode when running in tmux (suddenly work, not sure why, maybe I installed xclip?)
- [x] research if tmux keybinding support key sequence like `ctrl+a` then `c` to create new window (no need)
- [x] make alacritty start command to not create new tmux session if one is already running
- [x] create tmux keybindiing to split pane vertically and horizontally
- [x] create tmux keybindiing to open opencode pane from tmux (alt+o to open in split pane, alt+p to open in new window)
- [x] powershell script to link `alacritty.toml` to `%APPDATA%\alacritty\alacritty.toml`
- [x] experiment using ctrl+n or ctrl+t to create new window (is tmux has tab support?)
- [x] active window color indicator in tmux status bar to be more standout
- [x] remove doppler from nvin alias (v)
- [x] `ctrl+backspace` in neovim buffer to delete previous word (actually it is working in windows terminal)
- [x] try to make alacritty to start tmux automatically
